🛤️ Path Tracer
Path Tracer is an interactive React.js web application designed to visualize various pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). The app enables users to explore the intricacies of these algorithms in an intuitive, engaging, and visual manner.

🚀 Features
Pathfinding Algorithms: Visualize popular algorithms such as:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Interactive Node Selection:
Set start and end nodes.
Add or remove walls to create custom grid layouts.
Animated Algorithm Execution:
Watch the algorithm in action as it traverses the grid step-by-step.
Performance Tracking: Displays the time taken to complete each algorithm.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
Visualization: Custom animations for pathfinding progress
