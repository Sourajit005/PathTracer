# Path Tracer 🛤️ 
Path Tracer is an interactive React.js web application designed to visualize various pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).\
The app enables users to explore the intricacies of these algorithms in an intuitive, engaging, and visual manner.

## 🌟 Features

### 1. **Pathfinding Algorithms**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Guarantees the shortest path in weighted graphs.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores nodes level by level, ideal for unweighted graphs.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking.

### 2. **Interactive Node Selection**
- Set **start** and **end nodes** on a grid.
- Add or remove **walls** to create custom grid layouts and test different scenarios.

### 3. **Animated Algorithm Execution**
- Watch the algorithm traverse the grid step-by-step, visualizing its behavior in real-time.

### 4. **Performance Tracking**
- Displays the **time elapsed** for the completion of each algorithm.

## Technologies Used🛠️
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS\
Visualization: Custom animations for pathfinding progress
